Leveraging [AWS Lambdas](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/) for coding microservices or better say utility functions over API, for different projects has been my go-to option.  

but deploying them after making changes is a bit brain tiring loop. therefore i developed a plugin for IntelliJ IDEA.

### Old routine ðŸ¤•, dealing with lambda

```
Open IntelliJ
 â†³ Write code (AWS Lambda)
  â†³ Build artifacts
   â†³ Switch from IDE to browser
    â†³ Head to AWS Console and sign in (One time step)
     â†³ Open AWS Lambda or AWS S3 web page in console
      â†³ Browse to file/folder to upload your artifact to cloud and
        hit save
       â†³ If deploying more than one lambda artifact
        â†³ Open another tab, open AWS console, browse artifact and 
          hit save
         â†³ Repeat last two steps for all lambdas to be deployed
          â†³ Switch back to IDE
           â†³ Continue coding
            â†³ <Repeat till EOD>
```

### New routine ðŸ¤©  

```
Open IntelliJ
 â†³ Write code (AWS Lambda)
  â†³ Build artifact
   â†³ Deploy directly from IntelliJ IDE
    â†³ <Repeat till EOD>
```

### Bonus ðŸŽ„  

this plugin also helps in case you are dealing with multiple [AWS Named Profiles](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-multiple-profiles.html) or [AWS Organization](https://aws.amazon.com/organizations/)
