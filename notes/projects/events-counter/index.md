## What? 🤷‍♀️

A very simple API to count user events from your web and native applications.  

You can imagine a plethora of ways a user can interact with your website or software.  

Knowing how users interact with what parts of your application can help you as a product owner/developer in deciding whats best for your application's future implementations.  

## REST API 🚀

Its really simple REST API built with scalability in mind!

Two APIs:
- POST Counts
- GET Counts

Thats it!

## Current status 🗿

Done: ✅  
- API development
- Basic react library. [GitHub link](https://github.com/raevilman/react-events-counter)
- Test run, I have incorporated them here in this blog.  

Next: 👨‍💻  
- Dashboard (SPA website)
- Vue library

## Paid? 💸

Yep, need to pay bills (infra + home).  

$10/month for 100 counters.

## Release? 🦄

I am just working on the dashboard part. But as you can see, its working well on this blog.  

So if you want to jump right in and give it a try.
