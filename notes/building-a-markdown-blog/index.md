## context

I have been using OneNote to collect technical notes and Blogspot.com for blogging. The idea of combining both of them has been bugging my mind since the day I was introduced to Github Pages.

So the idea was to build a static website, where I can keep my notes.   

## checklist ✓

#### 1. markdown 🗒  
Considering the content lock-in I've experienced while using Blogspot. I decided to use markdown files for the post content.

#### 2.  gatsby 🤩
ReactJs based static site generator with a huge user community and a great number of plugins.  
Very awesome markdown support 👍  

#### 2.netlify 🙌
The obvious choice in comparison to Github-Pages for the ease of convenience.
