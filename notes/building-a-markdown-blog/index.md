## Context

I have been using OneNote to collect technical notes and Blogspot.com for blogging. The idea of combining both of them has been bugging my mind since the day I was introduced to Github Pages.

So the idea was to build a static website, where I can keep my notes.   

## Checklist ‚úì

#### 1. Markdown üóí  
Considering the content lock-in I've experienced while using Blogspot. I decided to use markdown files for the post content.

#### 2.  GatsbyJs ü§©
ReactJs based static site generator with a huge user community and a great number of plugins.  
Very awesome markdown support üëç  

#### 3. Netlify üôå
The obvious choice in comparison to Github-Pages for the ease of convenience.  

## Tutorial Series 

In this series, we will   
  - start by 
    - setting up a basic markdown blog without worrying about the looks.  
  - then 
    - deploy our blog to Netlify.  
  - at last, 
    - focus on enhancing the looks. [never ending process...]  

## Get Set, Go! üöÄ
