Let's add some markdown content to our blog.  

Create a folder in the project's root.  

```bash
mkdir notes
```
> I've named it `notes` because my blog's name is theRDnotes.  
> But you can name it `posts` or something else.  

### directory structure

You can choose to store all markdown files under `notes` folder.  
And the images can also be stored alongside.  

But that's a bit of mess in the future, when your blog will host like 1000s of articles.  

In my case, the website will be hosting notes on different technical topics.  
So having nested folders felt a good option to start with.  

Example:  
Notes on `logging in lambda`  will go under `aws/lambda/logging-in-lambda.md`  
and the `lambda` folder will host the image assets for that post as well other posts participating under `lambda` folder.

### frontmatter

Frontmatter is the additional data that is relevant to your post.  
You can specify this data as key-value pairs at the beginning of the file separated by three dashes at the start and end of the block.

Example:
```yaml

```

> In GatsbyJs, we'll use `GraphQL` to fetch this frontmatter data in our react components

### add content

Let's add the following two example markdown files under the notes folder.  

- notes/first-post.md

```yaml

# Welcome Again! ðŸ‘‹

- I am trying to continue on my resolution so far...  
- Lets hope for the best ðŸ¤ž  
```

### till next time!  

As of now, GatsbyJs doesn't have any idea about the markdown files we added above.  

In the next part, we will configure GatsbyJs to find and process these files into static HTML content.
