This note is regarding one issue I faced yesterday, where in I wasn't able to edit the docker configuration which was added using the option in context menu of DockerFile, as shown below:



![docker-modify-run-config](/Users/rdhawan3/code/git/raevilman/the-rd-notes/notes/intellij/docker-modify-run-config.png)





The solution was to get rid of this corrupted configuration and add a new one using edit configurations dialog itself.
I've recorded the below vlog about it.
