## What?
Buck is a tiny Android app that helps block unknown callers.
It is focused on privacy and minimal surface area â€” no ads, no tracking, and no servers.

- Free
- Configurable
- No ADs
- Does not collect any data

## Why?
Incoming unknown calls are a common nuisance. I built Buck as a lightweight, privacy-first utility to give users a simple way to avoid unknown callers without granting broad permissions or relying on servers.
