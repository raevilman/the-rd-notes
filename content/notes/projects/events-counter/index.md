## What? 🤷‍♀️

A very simple API to count user events from your web and native applications.  

You can imagine a plethora of ways a user can interact with your website or software.  

Knowing how users interact with what parts of your application can help you as a product owner/developer in deciding whats best for your application's future implementations.  

## REST API 🚀

Its really simple REST API built with scalability in mind!

Two APIs:
- POST Counts
- GET Counts

Thats it!

## Current status 🗿  

Done: 
- ✅  API development
- ✅  Website with dashboard. [EventsCounter.com](http://eventscounter.com/)
- ✅  Basic react library. [GitHub link](https://github.com/Events-Counter/react-events-counter)

<br/>

Next: 👨‍💻  
- ✨ Rules functionality
- 📅 VueJs library
- 📅 Js library

## Paid? 💸

Yep, need to pay bills (infra + home). But its dust cheap!  

As low as $4/month when paid annually. Check pricing on [website](http://eventscounter.com/).

<br/>

## Launch day? 🦄

Eh! You can use it right now!  
<br/>
As you can see its incorporated and working well on this blog. Page views counter on top and reactions counters at bottom are from `react-events-counter` library.  
<br/>
I'm using it with two other of my products, therefore I bake in feature as soon as I feel the need.  
<br/>
Give it a try!
